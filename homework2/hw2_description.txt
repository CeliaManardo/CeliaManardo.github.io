The first idea I had was to simulate rain falling in water. 
The bigger the drop would have been, the higher the energy.

Inspiration :
I was looking for p5.js tutorial and I found a YouTube channel "The coding train" 
which some of his videos were made using p5.js.
One particular videos was about creating fireworks called " ". I inspired myself to simulate my drop 
("a particle") falling. Then instead of creating multiple others particles when it explodes
I created ellipse to simulate the ripple.
I matched the size of the particle and the size of the ellipse with the rms energy quantity.
For the color of the particle, 

For the background, I used the beat detection function found here :
Since I wanted a dark background, I ajusted the code to fit my wanting.
But I was still thinking my background was too empty. My first idea was to visualise 
as a circle, the fft representation of the sound. But this circle was quite odd and didn't fit 
well with my water dropping in the foreground.
Then, I was looking into The coding train's channel and I saw a videos called "Perlin ".
It was looking more stubtle. Instead of using Perlin noise, I wanted the movement of my
background particle to follow the fft analysis.
