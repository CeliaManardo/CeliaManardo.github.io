   <h1> Creating 8 bit Music <br/>
			Information </h1>
</header>
 This website was made for you to have fun to recreate 
 famous 8 bit music from retro games but also for you
 to create your own 8 bit music.
 
 As the center of the page, you can see a keyboard. 
 This keyboard represents your actual keyboard.
 Moreover, each touch of the keyboard is map a musical note.
 For example, taping on the Q key will create the B4 note.
 
 Furthermore, you can change the waveforms of the synth used.
 In fact, most retro games used pulse, square, triangle and
 noise synth for the music. This is what I tried to recreate here.
 
 At the bottom at the page, you can click on two buttons to 
 listen to recreation of famous 8 bit games music.
