   <h1> Creating 8 bit Music <br/>
			Information </h1>
</header>
 This website was made for you to have fun to recreate 
 famous 8 bit music from retro games but also for you
 to create your own 8 bit music. <br/>
 <br/>
 As the center of the page, you can see a virtual keyboard. <br/>
 This keyboard represents your actual keyboard.<br/>
 Moreover, each touch of the keyboard is mapped to a musical note.<br/>
 For example, tapping on the Q key will create the B4 note.<br/>
 <br/>
 Furthermore, thanks to the button in the 1st box on the left of the screen, you can change the waveforms of the oscillator used.<br/>
 In fact, most retro games used pulse, square, triangle and
 noise oscillator for their music. This is what I tried to recreate here.<br/>
 <br/>
The second box on the left is to control the recording.<br/>
You can either start the recording or end it.<br/>
<br/>
The third box on the left is to control the recording you have just made.<br/>
You can either play it or stop it.<br/>
<br/>
The fourth box is to add effect to your sound. You can add a chebyshev and a reverb effect.<br/>
In addition, you can add a chebyshev/reverb effect to the oscillator that you want 
thanks to the 1st box on the left.<br/>
Clicking on "triangle" waveform, and then by manipulating the slider of reverb effect, 
you will affect the reverb effect on the triangle oscillator.<br/>
<br/>
The last box on the left is to redirect you to this webpage to give some
information on how to use the website.<br/>
<br/>
Under the virtual keyboard, there is a part for the visualization 
of the sound. Each time, you type on the keyboard, the
squares will be filled randomly. The color of the filling corresponds to the "waveform" chosen.<br/>
 <br/>
 At the bottom of the page, you can click on two buttons (Zelda or Mario) to 
 listen to famous 8 bit games musics.<br/>
 These two 8 bit musics were recreating using the same principe
 I'm using in this website. <br/>
 This is the website where I took
 them: <br/>

 I can also mention that while playing the music you can 
 see the keys being played in the music will light up in the virtual keyboard according to the mapping I have defined between the keys of the keyboard and the musical notes.<br/>
 By changing the "waveforms" (1st box on the left), you can see
 the key corresponding respectively to the pulse synth, square and triangle oscillator.<br/>
 The noise doesn't depend on the musical note played. Thus, randomly, I choose to 
 light up the Q key on the virtual keyboard.<br/>
